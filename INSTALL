INSTALLATION

To install this module, with the included scripts, type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

You should edit ~/.whatrc to fit your filesystem and what.cd account.
Look at the included 'whatrc' file for a template for you to copy, and
then customize.

CROSS-PLATFORM COMPATABILITY

So far, this package has only been extensively tested on Mac OS X. It
should also work with zero, or minimal difficulty on most Linux
distributions. 

I highly doubt that it will work on Microsoft Windows. Some kind MS Perl
hacker would need to come along and fix things that cause problems.

PERL PACKAGE DEPENDENCIES

What requires these non-standard modules and libraries from the CPAN:
    Getopt::Euclid
    Readonly
    Exception::Class
    Class::InsideOut
    Term::Readline
    Data::Dumper

The easiest way to get all these dependencies is to install the CPAN
module. You can get the latest version from the following link:
    http://search.cpan.org/~andk/CPAN/lib/CPAN.pm
Then read the CPAN documentation about installing modules (it's really
easy).

PROGRAM DEPENDENCIES

The What scripts also require free, cross-platform, external programs. 
Specifically,
    lame
    flac
