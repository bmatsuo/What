PREREQUISITES

In order to run the package tests when installing, you must have a 
free account and API key for www.discogs.com. The tests prompt you 
to enter this key, and it must be placed in your ~/.whatrc file. 

INSTALLATION

To install this module, with the included scripts, type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

You should edit ~/.whatrc to fit your filesystem and what.cd account.
Look at the included 'whatrc' file for a template for you to copy, and
then customize.

CROSS-PLATFORM COMPATABILITY

So far, this package has only been extensively tested on Mac OS X. It
should also work with minimal difficulty on most Linux
distributions. There is an issue where the OS X utility 'open' is 
called. Linux has no standard utitily for opening arbitrary files. 
Under Gnome, gnome-open can perform a similar task. The situation is
not ideal and should eventually disappear. But for now, snatch-inspect
and release-import will not work under Linux. I will try to make a patch
to allow these programs to work under gnome in the future.

I highly doubt that it will work on Microsoft Windows. Some kind MS Perl
hacker would need to come along and fix things that cause problems.


PERL DEPENDENCIES

What requires these non-standard modules and libraries from the CPAN:
    Getopt::Euclid
    Exception::Class
    Class::InsideOut
    Moose
    Term::Readline
    Data::Dumper
    MP3::Tag
    Audio::FLAC::Header
    XML::Twig

The easiest way to get all these dependencies is to install the CPAN
module. You can get the latest version from the following link:
    http://search.cpan.org/~andk/CPAN/lib/CPAN.pm
Then read the CPAN documentation about installing modules (it's really
easy).

PROGRAM DEPENDENCIES

The What scripts also require free, cross-platform, external programs. 
Specifically,
    lame                             (for MP3 reencoding)
    vorbis-tools (with FLAC support) (for OGG reencoding)
    faac                             (for AAC reencoding)
    flac                             (for FLAC stream decoding)
    mktorrent                        (for making torrent files)
    spek (command-line binary)       (for viewing spectrograms)

If you do not need any of these functional areas, you do not need to 
install the dependencies. The 'flac' dependency is required for
reencoding to pretty much any format though.

The 'vorbis-tools' dependency must be compiled with flac support.
If compiling from source, just read documentation about this option.
If installing vorbis-tools via a package manager. Look into the 
package managers documentation for variants/patches which will install
a package with flac support.

If you are installing vorbis-tools on Mac OS X with macports, then
the following command should install vorbis-tools properly:
    sudo port install vorbis-tools+flac
