ABSTRACT

The goal of the What package is to be the ultimate package of command-
line tools for What users. I stress the word users.

This is not a package of tools for seedboxes. 

The package currently centers around creating releases. Depending on user
feedback, more libraries and more programs will be added.

PACKAGE DEFECIENCIES

This package can not:
    Upload torrents to What.CD (probably never coming).
    OGG/Apple Lossless/AAC coversions.
    Non-ISO-Latin-1 characters in FLAC tags (I really want this) 
    Multi-disc rips (recently broken, HIGH on todo list)
    Check FLAC log rip files (todo).
    Create album descriptions (todo).
    Create release descriptions (todo).

UPLOAD DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

The library and program suite are set up to enforce a certain directory
structure. 

There is a root directory where all uploads are placed (henceforth called 
'the upload root'). Subdirectories of the upload root are named by 
artists.

Contained in each artist directory is one directory for each unique
release (i.e. album, single, ...) that has been ripped.

In each release directory, there is one folder for each format of the
release (FLAC, 320kbps, V0, V2, ...). Torrents for each format will also
reside in the release directory. Then the torrent's directory is the same
as the directory the torrent should downloaded to.

For releases with multiple discs, the library should soon support placing
files for each disc in seperate directories labeled 'CDX' for disc number
X.

Images should be placed in the top level of a format's directory, 
regardless of whether or not there are multiple discs in the release.
Log and CUE files should always be in the same directory as the same
music they describe.

Here is an example of the directory structure needed.

upload_root
|---Pop Star
|   `---Pop Star - 2010 - New Album
|       `---Pop Star - 2010 - New Album [FLAC]
|           |---Front.tiff
|           |---Back.tiff
|           |---Disc1.tiff
|           |---Disc2.tiff
|           |---CD1
|           |   |---01 A love song.flac
|           |   |---02 A sad song.flac
|           |   |   ...

PACKAGE WORKFLOW

The What package enforces a specific workflow. This should be fully
automated soon, but there are still kinks. There are two parts to
uploading; ripping and coverting/releasing. The term releasing is used
meaning checking for a complete release, creating a torrrent, and adding
the torrent to your preferred client.
                   
RIP WORKFLOW

All FLAC files should be ripped to the same directory (the 
'rip directory'). This directory should not  be in the upload hierarchy 
(it probably could be, if placed with care). 

Log and CUE files should accompany all your rips. The What package will 
not tolerate releases which can be trumped.

TIFF image scans of album artwork should also be placed in the rip
directory before releasing. TIFF album artwork is more or less required
at the moment. In the near future, there will be a way to require JPEG
images or even not require album artwork at all.

Ensure that all the necessary files are in the rip directory before
proceding to the releasing workflow.

RELEASE WORKFLOW

This is more-or-less automated this point. You need only run the
following command
    mkrelease \
        --artist "Indie Duo" --title "Darkest Darkness" --year 2010 \
        --flac --320 --v0 --v2
to release the band Indie Duo's brand new LP entitled Darkest Darkness in
all the best formats (really just the only ones supported at the moment).

Then you just need to upload the 4 respective torrents from your watch
directory (if they aren't deleted), or from in the upload hierarchy. This
should suit most of your uploading needs. Enjoy =)

RELEASE (UNDER THE HOOD)

After you rip a CD, run the command,
    release-scaffold \
        --artist <artist> --year <year> --title <title> \
        [--num-discs <num-discs>]
to create the paths to the necessary music directories.

If you want, you can run
    release-ok [--num-discs <num_discs>]
to check that you have included things like log files and CUE files in
the flac release directory. This will help make sure that your uploads 
aren't trumped by others that are more complete.

Move the FLAC and image files into their proper directories (see 
UPLOAD DIRECTORY STRUCTURE). This will probably be automated soon enough.

Then run 
    release-flac-convert \
        --artist <artist> --year <year> --title <title> \
        [--v0] [--v2] [--320]
to create other desired formats.

Finally run
    release-mktorrent \
        --artist <artist> --year <year> --title <title> \
        [--flac] [--v0] [--v2] [--320]
to create torrents for each desired format.
