ABSTRACT

What is a package of open source command-line tools for What users. 
This is not a package of tools for seedboxes. 
This is meant to help Joe Everyuser get a good ratio.

The package currently centers around creating releases. 
More libraries and programs will be added depending on user feedback.

PACKAGE FEATURES

This package can:
    Organize your all your releases into a user navigatable hierarchy.
    Create release descriptions.
    Create M3U playlists for releases.
    Convert M3U playlists for different format releases.
    Convert a FLAC release to:
        MP3 with 320, V0, or V2 bitrate settings.
        Ogg Vorbis with -q8 quality setting.
        AAC with ~256 ABR setting (don't use; FAAC sucks).
    Re-release FLAC / Log 100% / Cue snatches for tag trumps & better.php.
    Create torrents for releases.
    Convert release images to lower res versions for web hosting.
    Make you a sandwich, if you have permissions.

PACKAGE DEFECIENCIES

This package will probably never:
    Rip CDs to FLAC.
    Upload torrents.

This package can not currently:
    Score FLAC rip logs (coming).
    Perform multi-threaded conversions (soon hopefully).
    Create release descriptions.
    Make good MP3s w/ non-Latin-1 tags (=> mojibake (lame: L 2 utf-8)).
    Handle bandcamp.com releases (they keep getting more clever or something).
    Manage your personal media library.
    Manage your personal media archival/backup.
    Make Apple Lossless coversions (meh).
    Make 'perfect' AAC 320 CBR conversions (no good portable lib/app).

The above list is pretty much a todo list.
