====================

PREAMBLE

    This package presumes knowledge of the rules for What.CD. It will be
    far easier to understand what you are doing if you are familiar with
    the various rules for uploads.

    It's a good general rule of thumb to, before you do anything on What.CD 
    or another site, become aware of the rules on that site pertaining to 
    that activity. 

    Before you upload anything, you should have some knowledge about different 
    audio formats, trumping qualifications, naming, etc. It's probably best 
    to read one of the following wiki article links before you upload anything:

        https://ssl.what.cd/wiki.php?action=article&id=446
        http://what.cd/wiki.php?action=article&id=446

    Once you know what a proper rip is, and what is not allowed in a rip,
    you should know enough to understand the content of the package.

ABSTRACT

    'What' is a package of open source command-line tools for What users. 
    The package currently centers mostly around creating/packaging torrents.
    There is also functionality to help deal with snatches, specifically 
    perfect flac snatches.

    This package maintains a 'database' (directory hierarchy) of releases
    and torrents backed up by perfect FLACs. This is separate from your
    music library, and download directory. It then acts on that database
    via a collection of scripts.

    More functionality will be added depending on user feedback.

PACKAGE FEATURES

    This package can:

        Create a releases from a FLAC CD (or Vinyl?) rip or a perfect FLAC snatch.
        It will:

            Create M3U playlists (for each for format).
            Create a descriptions.
            Create torrents.

        Convert a FLAC release to:

            MP3 with 320, V0, or V2 bitrate settings.
            Ogg Vorbis with -q8 quality setting.
            AAC with ~256 ABR setting (don't use; FAAC sucks).

        Convert release images to lower res versions for web hosting.

        Convert FLAC releases to your desired format and add them to your playable
        music library (iTunes, Plex, XBMC, Amerok, ...).

        Make you a sandwich, if you have permissions.

PACKAGE DEFECIENCIES

    This package will probably never:

        Rip CDs to FLAC.
        Upload torrents.
