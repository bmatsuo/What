what version 0.00_04
=================

ABSTRACT

The goal of the What package is to be the ultimate package of command-
line tools for What users. I stress the word users.

This is not a package of tools for seedboxes. 

The package currently centers around creating releases. Depending on user
feedback, more libraries and more programs will be added.

RIP DIRECTORY STRUCTURE

The library and program suite are set up to enforce a certain directory
structure. 

There is a root directory where all rips are places (henceforth called 
'the rip root'). Subdirectories of the rip root are named by artists.

Contained in each artist directory is one directory for each unique
release (i.e. album, single, ...) that has been ripped.

In each release directory, there is one folder for each format of the
release (FLAC, 320kbps, V0, V2, ...). Torrents for each format will also
reside in the release directory. Then the torrent's directory is the same
as the directory the torrent should downloaded to.

For releases with multiple discs, the library should soon support placing
files for each disc in seperate directories labeled 'CDX' for disc number
X.

Images should be placed in the top level of a format's directory, 
regardless of whether or not there are multiple discs in the release.
Log and CUE files should always be in the same directory as the same
music they describe.

Here is an example of the directory structure needed.

rip_root

|       `---Pop Star - 2010 - New Album [FLAC]

RIP/UPLOAD WORKFLOW

First, before you rip a CD, run 
    release-scaffold \
        --artist <artist> --year <year> --title <title> \
        [--num-discs <num-discs>]
to create the paths to the necessary music directories.

Then rip the album to FLAC and scan the artwork as TIFF image(s).

If you want, you can run
    release-ok --artist <artist> --year <year> --title <title>
to check that you have included things like log files and CUE files in
the flac release directory. This will help make sure that your uploads 
aren't trumped by others that are more complete.

Then run 
    release-flac-convert \
        --artist <artist> --year <year> --title <title> \
        [--v0] [--v2] [--320]
to create other desired formats.

Finally run
    release-mktorrent \
        --artist <artist> --year <year> --title <title> \
        [--flac] [--v0] [--v2] [--320]
to create torrents for each desired format.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

What requires these non-standard modules and libraries from the CPAN:
    Getopt::Euclid
    Readonly
    Exception::Class
    Class::InsideOut
    Term::Readline
    Data::Dumper

The easiest way to get all these dependencies is to install the CPAN
module. You can get the latest version from the following link:
    http://search.cpan.org/~andk/CPAN/lib/CPAN.pm
Then read the CPAN documentation about installing modules (it's really
easy).
