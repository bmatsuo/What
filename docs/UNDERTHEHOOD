RELEASE (UNDER THE HOOD)

The whole process is done by stringing smaller scripts together.
When 

After you rip a CD, run the command,
    release-scaffold \
        --artist <artist> --year <year> --title <title> \
        [--num-discs <num-discs>]
to create the paths to the necessary music directories.

If you want, you can run
    release-ok [--num-discs <num_discs>]
to check that you have included things like log files and CUE files in
the flac release directory. This will help make sure that your uploads 
aren't trumped by others that are more complete.

Move the FLAC and image files into their proper directories (see 
UPLOAD DIRECTORY STRUCTURE). This will probably be automated soon enough.

Then run 
    release-flac-convert \
        --artist <artist> --year <year> --title <title> \
        [--v0] [--v2] [--320]
to create other desired formats.

Finally run
    release-mktorrent \
        --artist <artist> --year <year> --title <title> \
        [--flac] [--v0] [--v2] [--320]
to create torrents for each desired format.
