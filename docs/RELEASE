RELEASES

A proper release has the following things:
    Audio files
    A log file from a properly configured XLD (Mac OS X) or EAC (Windows/WINE)
    A cue file (also made by XLD and EAC)
    A picture (album artwork).

These files are always initially gathered in the same directory. This is called
the *rip directory*. 

For a release in the rip directory, the what package creates M3U playlists 
automatically for each disc as well as an infomation file (with .nfo extension) 
describing the release, giving information about the audio files' lineage.

The What package of programs then places the release in a hierarchical directory 
structure, the *upload hierarchy*, for storage while it is seeded.

UPLOAD HIERARCHY STRUCTURE

There is a root directory where all uploads are placed (henceforth called 
the *upload root*). Subdirectories of the upload root are named by artists. 
These are called *artist directories*.

Contained in each artist directory is one directory for each unique release 
(i.e. album, single, ...) that has been ripped. These are called 
*release directories*. 

In each release directory, there is a file Info.txt which should give some 
description of the individual released.

The structure described above is known as the *upload hierarchy*.

In each release directory, there is one folder for each format of the
release (FLAC, 320, V0, V2, Ogg ...). These folders are called 
*format directories*.  Torrents for each format will also reside in the 
release directory, next to the format directory.  The torrents' names 
will be the same as their corresponding format directory with a '.torrent' 
extension.

For releases with multiple discs, the audio files are placed in seperate 
subdirectories (*disc directories*).

Log and CUE files should always be in the same directory as the same
disc they describe.

Images can be placed in any folder of the release. At least one is required.

Here is an example of the directory structure needed.
