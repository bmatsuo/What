UPLOADING WORKFLOW

The What package enforces a specific workflow for uploading.  

There are two parts to uploading; ripping and releasing. 
Ripping is, as it sounds, extracting FLAC audio from the CD and 
placing it in the rip directory with log and cue files. 
Releasing is when:
    M3U playlists are created for audio files.
    A .nfo info file is created for the release.
    The files are moved into the upload hierarchy.
    Files are converted to different formats (optional).
    Torrents are made for a FLAC release and any other created formats.
    Finally, adding the torrent to the preferred client.

After this, the user must manually upload the torrent. That's it.

RIP WORKFLOW

All new releases should be ripped to the same directory (the 
*rip directory*). This directory should not be in the upload hierarchy. 

For single disc rips, all flac files should be placed directly in the
rip directory. For multidisc rips each disc's audio, log, and cue files
should be separated into subdirectories.

Log and cue files should accompany all your rips, and should be placed
in the rip directory. The What package will not tolerate releases which 
can be trumped! This actually might change later.

Images can be placed in the rip directory, or any subdirectory.
At least one image is required to create a release. TIFF, JPEG, and PNG 
images are recognizable by the package.

A release description Info.txt must be placed in the rip directory before
releasing. There are no required contents for Info.txt, (it can be empty). 
Its recommended that you use the program
    "Cross-Platform Description Generator (Python)" 
, that is in the Laboratory forum and on github, to make for Info.txt files.
Discogs searching is coming to the What package soon though.

Ensure that all the necessary files are in the rip directory before
proceding to the releasing workflow.

RELEASE WORKFLOW

This is more-or-less automated this point. You need only run the
following command
    mkrelease \
        --artist "Indie Duo" --title "Darkest Darkness" --year 2010 \
        --flac --320 --v0 --v2
to release the band Indie Duo's brand new LP entitled Darkest Darkness in
all the most popular available formats.

Then you just need to upload the 4 respective torrents from the upload 
hierarchy. 

Bandcamp.com releasing was recently broken. It may come back. 
But it probably won't be as automatic because their web request system
seems to be getting more sophisticated with this kind of stuff.

This should suit most of your uploading needs. Enjoy =)

If there are problems running mkrelease, see the file UNDERTHEHOOD for more
information about recoving in the rip workflow.

IMPORTING WORKFLOW

If you've downloaded a FLAC / Log (100%) / Cue torrent and want to both
categorize it in the upload hierarchy and possibly reencode it for 
better.php; then you need to use the program release-import

Say the snatch directory is at path 
    '/Users/Me/Music/DL/Artist - Title {2010} FLAC'

Then, much like releasing a rip, you use the command
    release-import \
        --artist Artist --title Title --year 2010 \
        --320 --v0 --v2 --ogg
        --snatch '/Users/Me/Music/DL/Artist - Title {2010} FLAC'

This will add the snatch into the upload hierarchy, convert it to the 
4 requested formats, and create 4 torrents.

Before the snatch is added to the upload hierarchy, you will be
guided through the process of checking the tags and a few spectrograms.
This will insure that you are importing a quality release.
